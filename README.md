# Treasury-Web-Scraping

## Project Overview
This project is designed to scrape treasury-related data from a specific website, process the data, and present it in a usable format. The script is implemented in Python and makes use of libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas` to extract and handle the data. 

## Contents
- **`webscraping_treasury.py`**: The main Python script that performs the web scraping, processes the data, and outputs the results.

## Installation
To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the script and start scraping data, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python webscraping_treasury.py
```
This will execute the scraping process, and the output will be stored in the format defined in the script (e.g., CSV, Excel).

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Scrapes treasury data from the target website (www.treasurydirect.gov)
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and structures the scraped data for easy analysis.
- **Output**: Saves the extracted data in a CSV file or another specified format.
